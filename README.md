# Face-Recognition-System


### Install

This project requires **Python** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/)
- [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/)
- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)

You can either import KNN algorithm from sklearn or can use the one we created in the template code.

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the [Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included. You can also use Jupyter Notebook as per convenience.

### Code

Template code is provided in the `face_recogniser.py` and `Face_Recognition.py`. 

### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory (that contains this all the files) and run one of the following commands:

```bash
python face_recogniser.py
```  
or open with Jupyter Lab
```bash
jupyter lab
```

This will open the Jupyter Notebook software and project file in your browser.
